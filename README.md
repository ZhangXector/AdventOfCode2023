Advent of Code
==============
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview
prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge
each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge
and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every
problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

I will be attempting to solve this year's puzzles in Rust as a way to learn the language and to
broaden my programming skill set.
